                <p>I wanted to be a writer from a young age but opted for a safer career—”safe”
both financially and from the vulnerability of being judged for exploring the
complexity of human nature.</p>

<p>I met my long-term partner online, and our relationship started with writing: 
emails that explored both vulnerability and desire, followed by sexy short stories.
She loves reading erotica, and in the confines of our relationship, I felt safe
writing it for her. Sometimes I’d write vignettes based on our own experiences.
Other times I’d write a short story based on a simple prompt she’d give me, like
“Lady in Waiting.” (I admit, I had to look up what that was as I was boarding a plane
to Bangkok for a business trip. Two weeks later, I came back with a story for her.)</p>

<p>I was never very good at it, to be honest. She wanted fun titillation—a
Literotica-style beach read. I kept drifting toward uncomfortable feelings, using
erotica as a lens for emotional interiority. It was like a weird role reversal of
gender stereotypes: she wanted sex; I wanted words and feelings.</p>

<p>The first prompt she ever gave me was “Mayan Ruins,” to build anticipation of
an upcoming vacation to Playa del Carmen. That was early in our relationship,
before the real-life complexities of health and family and long-term partnership
had reared their heads. Being the clever wordsmith, I secretly toyed with the idea
of writing <em>Maya, Ruined</em>—some <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em>-style scheming to make sure Maya had a
Very Good Time.</p>

<p>It was years before I actually started writing <em>Mayan Ruins</em>. By then, those
real-life complexities had arrived, and the world at large felt darker and more
dangerous. Exhausted from my safe career, I took advantage of a sabbatical to
revisit my writing dreams, and embraced the kind of writing where characters
feel real and complex, three-dimensional sculptures rather than simple caricatures.
By picking up a prompt that had been abandoned for nearly a decade, I gave myself
the safety of pretending that I was still writing for someone else, allowing me to
explore vulnerability and human nature more deeply than I ever had before.</p>

<p>As long as Maya got properly ruined in the end.</p>
